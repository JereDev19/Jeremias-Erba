## 👤 About Me

I'm a student at Hoberton School and a software developer who started out as a curious kid who wanted to create whatever he could think of. Now working to make that desire a reality. With excellent soft skills such as teamwork, communication and problem solving. I am passionate about coding and constantly strive to improve my technical skills. Currently, I am focused on learning C# and Python with SQL including ORM. On the FrontEnd, I mainly use JavaScript with React framework but especially focus on the backend.
